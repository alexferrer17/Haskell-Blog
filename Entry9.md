# Lambda Calculus

 we focused on Lambda Calculus. Lambda calculus is a way to define the logic of function abstraction by using binding and substitution. It is a flexible language and is composed of three different `elements`, `Functions`, `Variables`, and `Applications`.  It is one of the more simple models of computation that is used to stimulate any Turing machine, which is a programming that is foundational mathematics and not practical math.

An interesting fact about Lambda is that it has an infinite sequence of outputs. Unlike the mere true or false answers, Lambda process runs forever with the `true`,`false`,`true`, `false`...`solutions`.

An example of this theory is

```
x^2-2*x+5
 ```
What would the value of this equation be when the `x = 3`?

it would be 8 right since we plug 3 into the x´s of the equation. To use the lambda equation we would have to start with the lambda  like:

```
λx[x^2-2*x+5]
```

The lambda operator allows us to abstract over x. Understanding that we could reduce an expression we figured out what B reduction is.
